# DevExtreme Angular Form - Getting Started 

This repository stores the code examples of the Angular Form component for the [Getting Started with Form](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Form/Getting_Started_with_Form/) tutorial. The component allows users to create a data entry UI for the underlying data object. The Form interface consists of automatically-arranged label-editor pairs that correspond to data fields. 

Users can change data values, validate inputs, and send the resulting data to the server. This tutorial shows how to add the Form to a page, bind it to data, and configure its core features.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
